# WOTCArchetypeNotCreatedEqual

A small XCOM 2 War of the Chosen mod that alters how soldiers are generated. Instead of random stat rolls, recruits are assigned to weighted quality bands with defined stat ranges and archetype influences. This ensures distinct, gritty soldiers while preserving Long War balance.

## Features

- **Weighted Stat Bands**: Soldiers are rolled into quality brackets rather than purely random values.
- **Archetype Flavours**: Archetypes steer the stat distribution, giving troops recognizable builds and personalities.
- **Balanced for LW**: Designed to work without breaking the balance of Long War campaigns.

## Installation

1. Copy the `WOTCArchetypeNotCreatedEqual` folder to your `XCom2/Mods` directory.
2. Ensure the mod is enabled in the XCOM 2 mod launcher.
3. Start a new campaign for changes to take effect.

## Usage

No in-game settings. The system automatically applies to all newly generated soldiers.
